# Skills Portfolio

This monorepo contains a collection of projects demonstrating my expertise in **AI Engineering**, **Golang**, **Java/Spring**, and **Python**. I focus on building production-ready applications with Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and modern infrastructure.

## 🤖 AI & Python Projects
